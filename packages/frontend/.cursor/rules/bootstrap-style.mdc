# Bootstrap Style Guide

When working on the frontend, always use [Bootstrap](mdc:https:/getbootstrap.com) styles and components as much as possible. This includes:

- Prefer using Bootstrap utility classes (e.g., `container`, `row`, `col`, `btn`, `form-control`, etc.) for layout, spacing, and UI elements.
- The app uses a dark style with Bootstrap dark styling, so don't use any absolute color references.
- Use Bootstrap's built-in components (cards, forms, buttons, alerts, etc.) before creating custom styles.
- Only write custom CSS or use non-Bootstrap components if the required design cannot be achieved with Bootstrap.
- Reference Bootstrap documentation for class names and usage examples.
