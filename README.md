# Prerequsites

- Install the Node version specified in `mise.toml` (or just use Mise)
- Install [cargo-lambda](https://www.cargo-lambda.info/guide/installation.html)

# Local Dev

`pnpm dev`

Starts `packages/frontend pnpm dev` and `cargo lambda watch`.
Frontend on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and backend on :9000.

# Info

- TypeScript packages live in `packages/*`. `pnpm` workspaces are utilized. Use `corepack prepare --activate` to get started.
- Rust crates live in `crates/*`. Add new crates with `cargo new crates/<name> --(bin|lib)`.
    - `cargo test` assumes DynamoDB Local is running. Start it with `pnpm dev`
- Backend infrastructure is managed by AWS CDK. See [Deploy docs](./packages/cdk/README.md) for more info.

# Useful commands

- `pnpm update -i --latest -r` update all npm packages recursively
